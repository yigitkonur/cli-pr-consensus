All changes passed TypeScript compilation, ESLint, and production build verification.

clean lint/typecheck state.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Removed large development/planning artifacts and coverage docs (`.foundation/`, `Next-Steps/`, `docs/`, `FIXES_LOG.md`).\n- Updated `.gitignore` with broader patterns for build outputs, IDE/OS artifacts, caches, temp files, and secrets.\n- Fixed code quality issues across many pages (unused imports/vars and JSX unescaped entities) and added repo-facing docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).\n\n### Reviewed changes\n\nCopilot reviewed 86 out of 87 changed files in this pull request and generated no comments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show a

        "rawBody": "## Pull request overview\n\nPrepares the repo for production deployment by removing development artifacts, tightening repository hygiene, and bringing the Next.js/TS codebase to a clean lint/typecheck state.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Removed large development/planning artifacts and coverage docs (`.foundation/`, `Next-Steps/`, `docs/`, `FIXES_LOG.md`).\n- Updated `.gitignore` with broader patterns for build outputs, IDE/OS artifacts, caches, temp files, and secrets.\n- Fixed code quality issues across many pages (unused imports/vars and JSX unescaped entities) and added repo-facing docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).\n\n### Reviewed changes\n\nCopilot reviewed 86 out of 87 changed files in this pull request and generated no comments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show a

clean lint/typecheck state.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Removed large development/planning artifacts and coverage docs (`.foundation/`, `Next-Steps/`, `docs/`, `FIXES_LOG.md`).\n- Updated `.gitignore` with broader patterns for build outputs, IDE/OS artifacts, caches, temp files, and secrets.\n- Fixed code quality issues across many pages (unused imports/vars and JSX unescaped entities) and added repo-facing docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).\n\n### Reviewed changes\n\nCopilot reviewed 86 out of 87 changed files in this pull request and generated no comments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show a
